Study Questions
---------------

For each class, we will give you study questions for you to work on for the next class lecture and readings assignments. Try to answer study questions regularly.

Quizzes
-------

Expect a quiz every week, focusing on both the lectures and readings. The quizzes are often unannounced. There is a final exam for this course.

Writing Requirements
--------------------

There will be at least four writing assignments, consisting of homework problems and literature analysis and review.

Do not copy sentences from your sources and paste them into your writings. Such plagiarism will often be detected. It is not worth the chance of being caught, which is significantly above zero, and the consequences are very unpleasant. Have confidence in your ability to use your own words and cite the source of specific information. If you are having problems, please see the instructor or a TA.
